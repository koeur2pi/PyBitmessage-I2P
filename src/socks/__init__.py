This module provides a standard socket-like interface for Python
for tunneling connections through SOCKS proxies.

Minor modifications made by Christopher Gilbert (http://motomastyle.com/)
for use in PyLoris (http://pyloris.sourceforge.net/)

Minor modifications made by Mario Vilas (http://breakingcode.wordpress.com/)
mainly to merge bug fixes found in Sourceforge

This module has been GUTTED rather than bypassed by Marc D. Wood for i2pbm
